// Function Definition : A function is Collection of statements grouped together to perform an operation
  
example: int findArea(int length, int breadth){
                function body
                return length*breadth;  
		}

/* while return type in dart is optional, if you remove this integer even then program will run fine. */
            
 example:   void findArea(int length, int breadth)
            {
                function body
                return length*breadth;
                }

/*  if we use void as return type but void in dart means we are not returning anything  from method body but void is also optional. 
    

        // properties of function in dart
        -> Function in Dart are objects.
        -> Function can be assigned to be variable or passed as parameter to other function.			
        -> All function in dart return value 
        -> If no return value is specified the function return NULL
        -> Specifying return type is optional but is recommended as per code convention */
